## General Principles

1. **Personalize every reply** — reference the specific issue or feature the reviewer mentioned
2. **Keep it concise** — 2–4 sentences is ideal, max 5,970 characters
3. **Never be defensive** — acknowledge the problem, don't argue
4. **No legal promises** — avoid guarantees about timelines, refunds, or fixes
5. **No personal data** — never reference account details, email, or purchase info
6. **Match the language** — reply in the same language as the review
7. **Include a call to action** when appropriate — support email, feedback channel

## Multi-Language Guidelines

When a review is written in a non-English language:

1. Detect the language from the review body and territory
2. Reply in that same language
3. Maintain the same tone and structure as the English templates
4. Common territories and languages:
   - `USA`, `GBR`, `AUS`, `CAN` → English
   - `DEU`, `AUT`, `CHE` → German
   - `FRA`, `BEL` → French
   - `JPN` → Japanese
   - `KOR` → Korean
   - `BRA` → Portuguese
   - `ESP`, `MEX`, `ARG` → Spanish
   - `ITA` → Italian
   - `NLD` → Dutch
   - `CHN` → Simplified Chinese
   - `TWN` → Traditional Chinese
   - `TUR` → Turkish
   - `RUS` → Russian

5. If unsure of language, default to English
